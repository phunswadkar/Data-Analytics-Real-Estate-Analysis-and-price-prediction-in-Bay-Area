 The project included several important phases, involving web-scraping of the rental listings from a real-estate website, Point2Homes and then applying various data exploration methods to understand the Data. After preprocessing and analyzing the data, we then came up with multiple models including regression, and a predictive tool that is independent of any correlation using K-NN algorithm, further we visualized the results of this algorithm in Power Bi and built an interactive solution to help Users/Customers find the properties based on their Budget and Area requirements.
