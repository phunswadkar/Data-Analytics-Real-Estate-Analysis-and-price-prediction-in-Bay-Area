## Steps for Analysis:
The data was scraped from Point2Homes using a web scraping uitlizing Beautiful Soup.
The data was then cleaned and preprocessed using Python.
Multiple models were developed using regression and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
The results of the models were visualized in Power BI.

#### Tools and Technologies: Python, Power BI, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Conclusion: 
The result of the project was a successful development of a predictive models that was able to accurately predict the price of rental properties based on the user's budget and area requirements. The models can also be used by real estate agents to help their clients find the perfect rental property. The project was a valuable learning experience and it helped me to develop my skills in data scraping, data cleaning, data preprocessing, machine learning, and data visualization
